Creating Content in Wireframe Mode
==================================

In Neos users can start adding content immediately after a site has been created, even
if no design has been implemented yet. This is possible with the `Raw Content` editing mode
that can be switched on Edit/Preview panel.

It allows the creation of arbitrary content elements, rendering everything in a stripped down representation.
