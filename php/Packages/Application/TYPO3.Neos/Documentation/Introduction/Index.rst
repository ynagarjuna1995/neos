Introduction
============

TYPO3 Neos is not just another CMS. Instead, the TYPO3 community has created it based
on the previous experiences. It's not the first CMS built, but instead there is a big
amount of knowledge which has accumulated over the last 15 years.

This chapter starts with an overview of the :ref:`guiding-principles` of Neos, its
:ref:`system-structure` and :ref:`which features <feature-list>` make Neos special.
